# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

This project is based on https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator.

The ``calculate()`` function, which calculates the mean, variance, standard deviation, maximum value, minimum value, and summation of a 3x3 matrix as required by the instructions, could be found in ``mean_var_std.py``.
